**Hackathon 2023 Task Description**:
The code provided in this repository is part of a hackaton organized by Sollich KG, a company that produces tempering machines for chocolate processing.
The tempering process of chocolate involves three stages: heating, cooling, and mixing. The process aims to create high-quality chocolate with optimal taste, appearance, texture, and shelf life.
- **Task**: Train a model to estimate the target variable (temperature of the last sensor in a tempreign machine) and build a python script that can calculate the regression for a given set of input files in the parquet format.
- **Dataset**: Datasets are four weeks of production data from a laboratory tempering machine. The dataset contains 13 sensor points and two target variables for mass and water temperatures at the mixing stage.
