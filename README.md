1 Introduction
High-quality produced chocolate is indispensable in the production of all kinds
of confectionery. In order to produce these high-quality products, the chocolate itself need to be tempered in a defined manner. This tempering process
is the very first step in every production. Customers as well as manufacturers
announce clear requirements regarding the quality of the choclate. The requirements are as follows:
• Excellent taste: Taste is the primary selling point. An exceptional flavor
is therefore of high importance for the success of a chocolate product.
• Customer demands: Demands are not focused on the taste, but also on
the appearence and texture of the chocolate represents essential features
of high-quality chocolate.
• Reputation and trust: A consistent quality of chocolate enhances the
reputation and customer trust in the company.
• Processing efficiency: In context of an industrial production process,
flow characteristics, a clean break, a glossy surface and easy release after
a molding process are crucial parameters. Such parameters can only be
achieved by a high-quality chocolate mass and a stable tempering.
To meet these demands, the company Sollich KG from Bad Salzuflen has
been manufacturing high-quality machinery for processing confectionery for over
100 years. Specifically, they produce tempering machines for the pre-processing
of chocolate mass. Only through stable pre-tempering a crispy chocolate with
good flow properties and a distinctive shine is achieved. The correct tempering
increases shelf life and prevents the formation of fat bloom on the end product.
The process has been mastered steadily for decades. However, for sustainable production, it is important to avoid unnecessary hardware, in order to lower
energy consumption, implementation work and costs. Therefore, Sollich is interested in utilizing methods from the field of artificial intelligence (e.g. machine
learning, stochastic processes or optimization). This is ensured through modern
sensors and continuous data collection in the machines of the newest generation.
Current endeavors in the preliminary development of new machine generations
aim to implement the use of soft sensors for process control. Soft sensors will
not only save steel parts in the tempering section, but also reduce complexity
of the electrical wiring, save electrical parts like IO cards and therefore time.
To reach this goal a precision of at least 0.1 °C has to be assured.
